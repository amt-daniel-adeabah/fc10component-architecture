# fc10component-architecture

## Summary
An onboarding flow of an app that requires users to go through a series of forms with some consistency in layout without navigating to different pages.

## Objective

This challenge is to help devs utilize core concepts of the framework to be used. 

The challenge is also geared towards the design and architecture of components that are reusable and scalable.

Welcome various implementation techniques for learning and discussion.

## Tasks

Design and develop the various screens for the userâ€™s onboarding with any choice of framework

On each screen, render a different image as in the design or any other transparent background image of your choice

Add to your README file a description of your approach to meeting this requirement

## Delimitations

The forms and their interaction are not important. Focus on the functionality of switching from one screen to the other.

No CSS framework should be used for styling

It is allowed to brainstorm as a team and work together
